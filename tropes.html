  <h2>Tropes</h2>
  <p>Anime tropes are in their own unique world. These are the classic cases of commonalities that show up once, and then keep on showing up. That's why they are tropes. However, of course with their Japanese flavor and the anime twist, these are the common tropes that will continue to exist. These are very general and don't include other more subgenre tropes that are littered in say romance or action anime.</p>
