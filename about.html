<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	Welcome! <br>
	This is a passion project with the sole desire to let interested folk that are slipping into anime become accustomed to the basics in order avoid misstepping and finding the world is too big to handle (AKA, getting confused because there's so many things out there). To avoid feeling overwhelmed and not enjoying, or even deciding to not watch, anime, this guide will clarify terms that may mystify the anime community, and then push you out into the world with tips on finding new shows after giving you recommended anime to start off with. Anime won't exclusively be the two step formula, or even the anime you like will be what are listed here, so remember that there's a spot for everyone.
</p>
<p>
	To remove bias (as someone who also judges by art styles and age of the work--both for different reasons), recommended anime are sorted specifically so you will have to click through so that all of the content can be consumed without overlooking possible gems (and my short commentary of the storyline).
