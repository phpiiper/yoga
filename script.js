["Tsundere","One of the most popular of the  \"-dere\" archetypes (There being 4 famous main archetypes that end with \"-dere\") that will most certainly show up in at least one anime you watch. These characters are embarrassed by praise and affection (basically all gushy emotions), and will often deflect it through their harsh words or actions toward the main character (even though deep inside, they are a soft ball of fluff) to hide it. They are often comically violent if they are female(lots of Anime gags are physical). For new viewers, it might look like abuse, however it's clear when it's abuse versus being tsundere.","tsundere.jpg",[
["title","Toradora"]
]],
["Yandere","Another type of the \"-dere\" archetypes, it’s either used as a gag from the creepy side character, or used specifically in psychological thriller horror anime. Although not used in anime as often, they are still a useful term to learn since its used a lot in the anime community. Yanderes are dangerous, obsessive toward the character of interest to the point that they will dispose of anyone who shows interest in that character before disposing of the character themself, or make it so that they can only look at them. The red flag character that is referenced more than it’s shown in standard anime.","yandere.png",[
["title","Future Diary"]
]],
["Lolis / Shotas","This is something that I can only hope to explain as “just anime things.” Lolis show up typically in a character’s mother as they will often be much smaller in comparison to the character themself to then be mistaken as a younger sibling. (Note: This is different from lolita characters who often are \"loli,\" but dress in the Japanese lolita style) In a certain genre, they are typically the (failed) love interests that’s shown on the side lines (often, a little sister of some sort--\"just anime things\"). Shotas, on the other hand, show much more often in male orientated shows (or similarly, in a certain female-orientated genre). They often have a much more brattier role to play (such as being called \"shortie\" or short-tempered). It is also slightly more normalized (if you couldn't tell by all the lolis and shotas in anime) to like characters with these specific physical attributes, so reactions to these characters in the anime's universe may seem strange at first glance (though there are some that go over that line).","loli.jpg",[
["title","Masamune no Revenge"]
]],
["Comedic Violence","Much of Japanese humor is physical, so anger being manifested by an extremely red face, fire coming out of their mouth, or someone hitting their head against the wall but the next scene they're complete back to normal? Or, even in the stranger cases, growing mushrooms in a corner because they're sad their love interest is ignoring them? Yep, these are not supposed to be taken literally. Might take some time to adjust, but it's definitely going to in every anime.","comedicv.jpg",[
["title","Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun"]]
],
["Spot the Main Character","Honestly, it’s to the point that in every action anime (typically Shounen action shows), the protagonist sticks out. Whether it be the hair style and color that’s absolutely crazy compared to the other brown and black haired characters, then in other genres (such as romance), it’s because they specifically have black or brown hair and have the most inconspicuous hairstyle. Add glasses and long bangs so you can’t see their eyes, and you’re all set! (Or in female romance, they often tend to be “bland” looking compared to their love interest--no blond or pink hair here)","mc.png",[
["title","Cardfight!! Vanguard"]
]],
["Monologues","Found in mostly action anime (and not exclusive to just anime alone), there will be long monologues from villains even though the protagonist could defeat them (or even save their friends) if they just interrupted them. But, of course, time flows differently in anime and TV shows than the real world. Because the plot is more important that time.","mono.jpg",[
["title","Dragon Ball Z"]
]],
["Love Triangle","Although less common in a few of the recent years’ line up, the protagonist of the story will be popular with at least two people (that are often admired or idolized by other characters). Even in non-romance specific anime, this is common.","ltriangle.jpg",[
["title","Nisekoi"]
]],
["Stupid Protagonist","As in, the protagonist is dense about their love life, have terrible grades in school, or (in action anime) confront things head-on and never learn the second, third, and nth time. Or, you can get a character that does all of them. Depending on the genre, these characters will be seen a lot, or a little.","protag.png",[
["title","Kämpfer"]
]],
["Perfect Protagonist","In which there is nothing wrong with the protagonist (personality). The trademark perfect protagonist helps everyone and is nice to everyone regardless of their status or what they have done to them. They can sometimes be seen as self-inserts as love interests flock to this character and slowly fall for them because they're kind (and maybe not like other guys/girls?).","perf.png",[
["title","Sword Art Online"]
]],
["OP Protagonist","Seen in many action/fantasy shows (many of the [isekai] subgenre), these characters are either seriously over powered in either in intelligence or power. You don't watch the show to see the protagonist develop, but just how they are going to progress the story.","op.jpg",[
["title","The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt"]
]],
["Nosebleeds","For mostly comedic effect, and a feature of many older anime, the male protagonist if he (and you) get to witness some [fanservice] (see Term: Ecchi), they will spurt out an unreasonably inhumane amount of blood and fall backwards (back to the physical comedy anime does). Female characters also do this (however the excess amount of blood is more likely to be seen from side characters than the main lead).","nosebleed.jpg",[
["title","Baka no Test"]
]],
["Oppai","Yes, the Japanese word for breasts. Many (in mostly male-orientated anime) female characters fall under this category with intense \"jiggle-physics\" accompanied with \"jiggle sounds.\" Used most commonly for fanservice (male-orientated anime), or for [slice-of-life] gags (often the airheaded character who is the object of jealousy by another female character without the “oppai.”)","oppai.jpg",[
["title","Assassination Classroom"]
]],
["Villainess","A relatively hot trope of late in written works, protagonist (predominantly female) is reincarnated into a dating sim (See term: \"Otome Game\") as not the original player, but rather the villainess who attempts to ruin the relationship between the original player and any of her love interests. This character will die because in the original game, the villainess dies. Typically it's because every decision of the game will somehow lead to the villainess' death. So, the main character tries to avoid death, and probably creates a harem of her own, or find that the prince that is supposed to be the heroine fell for her instead (pick your poison).","villainess.jpg",[

Most anime will have an intro song and an ending song to each episode (even those bite-size anime that are only 5-10 minutes long). I didn't really think this would be a concern, but to put it out there, the visuals of the MVs don't always reflect the anime (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgo9dJB_icw\" target=\"_blank\">Beastars</a> and, quite famously, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DwbXmr70C0\" target=\"_blank\">Death Parade</a>)",

Artists like \"LiSa\" and \"Kenshi Yonezu\" may come up as many of their songs are top hits (even outside of the anime world). Though, even my favorite anime songs (sometimes shortened to ani-song or in Japan, even to A-Pop) are based on iffy quality anime, so pick your poison wisely.",

The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM4laths4-Y\" target=\"_blank\">opening<a/> for Ao no Ride is a Honeyworks song, but the MV shown there is unrelated to the anime it is for, to give an example."
