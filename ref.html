		<tbody>
		<tr> <td>Crunchyroll</td> <td>This is the most popular (free) streaming platform. Lots of notable anime, some obscure, and others of some popularity are licensed here.</td></tr>
		<tr> <td>Funimation</td> <td>The website where the English dubbed voice acting are licensed (and also behind a paywall), although Funimation is still merged into Crunchyroll, it however still has certain licenses exclusive to them compared to Crunchyroll.</td></tr>
		<tr> <td>MyAnimeList</td> <td>The website is a user sourced "database" with its own community. This is my personal go-to if I'm unsure about watching a show and seeing if it's well liked, or reading reviews after I finish a show to see how other people responded to it. As it also lists the voice actors, staff, and studio involved, it's easier to navigate to their specific works if you like a particular person. </td></tr>

			Everything bootstrap was found on bootstrap. Wow. Except, when searching up references, the first result might be from a previous version, and you wonder why the site isn't working.</ul></li>
			<li>Kotaku</li>
